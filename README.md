## About
Zeplin for Microsoft Teams app brings all the important updates to Microsoft Teams to keep your teammates up-to-date with the changes happening in Zeplin. You can connect Microsoft Teams channels to related Zeplin projects. You can also pick and choose the type of notifications that flow from Zeplin to Microsoft Teams. If you want to start connecting your Zeplin projects or styleguides to Microsoft Teams channels, head over to [our guide](https://zpl.io/msteams-integration-help) for more details.

### Get notified of design changes
Designers frequently iterate on designs. When they’re ready to be shared with the team, that’s when they publish their work to Zeplin. With this application, once a design is published to Zeplin, the rest of the team will automatically get notified in the Microsoft Teams channel.

Not only do you get a preview of the design, you can also see the commit message where the designer describes what has changed. You can quickly open the design in Zeplin as well, either in the desktop app or the Web app, and start working.

### Follow the conversation happening in Zeplin
Zeplin is also the place where the team communicates over the designs. You can add notes to a specific area of a design to ask questions, suggest changes and so on. As these conversations are happening in Zeplin, you can keep the rest of the team up-to-date using this application.
